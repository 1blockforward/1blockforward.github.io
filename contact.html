      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        As most of you may know I have a YouTube channel. Everyday I get inspired to make videos. Whether it's a speed art, gameplay video, music video, or something else. Some people think I'm just a lazy kid who sits in front of the computer watching pointless videos, but I'm much more than that! The reason why I sit in front of my computer and watch other people's YouTube videos because no matter who or what you're watching, there's inspiration everywhere!

        My life is pretty normal. I have a mom, a dad, and a super annoying sister. The channel known as 1blockforward was originally going to be my sister's channel. But she didn't want it so our parents gave it to me. Me and my friends love to play videos games together such as Minecraft. Some of the video games I play on my channel were introduced by my friends. I learned about Undertale from Paulie who made me super addicted to the game and now I have a hoodie of Frisk and Chara. I learned about most of the webgames I play from Ella.
