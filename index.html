        Hello everyone! This is 1blockforward, and this is my blog! Here I'll talk about my YouTube channel and some of my life. I'll also include some background knowledge on how I make my videos.

            You're probably wondering why Ella's icon is the picture next to this text rather than mine or a picture of me. It' because she is my friend and she also has a YouTube channel. Now you're probably wondering why I didn't put ECuber's icon on here. It's because...well, I have my reasons. Anyway, hello everyone! Most of you may know me due to my YouTube channel. I probably love YouTube as much as LOVE means "Level of Violence" in the Undertale genocide run. YouTube has been my friend since I was in the second grade. When I started my channel I was just doing for fun and I wasn't really intrested in money or views or subscribers. But when one of my videos got to 100 views, I knew that was a start.

            Working on my channel has changed my life ever since. Now, when I don't have a computer in front of me, I draw in hopes of getting an idea for a speed art. I'm no longer sleeping in until 10:00 a.m. thinking of nothing. I'm up at 9:00 a.m. (not a great improvement) and either drawing my brain off or thinking of video ideas. I also have to thank my friends and favorite YouTubers for the content of my channel. My friends because they introduced me to some of the things on my channel such as Undertale. My favorite YouTubers because they also introduced me to some of the things on my channel such as speed arts and Minecraft: Story Mode. When my channel wasn't very popular, I didn't even imagine of reaching the level of Ella or ECuber. But now, I...um, I don't want to brag so I'm just going to stop here.

         Hello everyone! This is 1blockforward, and welcome to my channel! On my channel I do short animations, minecraft videos, undertale game-play, speed arts, and much more! Anyway, I  may not be as popular as like say PewDiePie or Jacksepticeye, but (I'm sorry if you think I'm bragging) my videos are entertaining. I'm a YouTuber that is open to suggestions, so if you'd like to see something on my channel, I'll definitely consider it! Two of my friends also have Youtube channels. They are NerdE Giraffe and ECuber. Oh, and if you do indeed like my videos then please do consider subscribing, for your subscription is most appreciated. Don't forget to tell your friends about my channel. Oh, and don't forget: PAINT ON! ;)
